# Heart-Desease-Prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A  machine learning application designed to predict heart disease based on medical data. The system utilizes various classification algorithms to analyze patient data and determine the likelihood of heart disease.

**## Features**
- **Predictive Analysis:** Classifies patients as having heart disease or not using ML models.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and SVM for optimized accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding for better model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze risk factors associated with heart disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows real-time predictions using trained models.

**## Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Handling:** Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Preprocessing  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM  
- **Deployment:** Flask API for real-time predictions
